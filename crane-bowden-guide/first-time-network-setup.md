# First time Network Setup

Connecting to your M3D Crane Series Printer via your local network is very useful as you get access to the **Duet Web Console**. You can connect your M3D Crane Series Printer to your local network via the **Ethernet port on the Duet Maestro.** Once the network settings are properly configured, you will be able to connect to the **Duet board** and access the **Duet Web Console**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The M3D Crane Series printers are pre-configured to easily work with the most common network configuration, **DHCP**. If however you have a more complex network configuration, it may be necessary to further edit your network settings.
{% endhint %}

Pre-configured network settings are loaded onto every SD card before the printer goes out our door, these network settings utilize **DHCP** in order to get an IP address from your router. This should allow your M3D Crane Bowden to connect automatically to your network. 

Once connected via **Ethernet** your ****M3D Crane Series printer will display an **IP address** on it's LCD screen.
