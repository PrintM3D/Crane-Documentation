# Pro Tuning

The M3D Crane printer has a number of adjustment points for each axis. 
In the picture below, the red arrows indicate adjustment points for the frame, the yellow arrows indicate eccentric nuts for adjusting the tension on each axis, and the blue circles indicate the tensioning point for the belts.

Each type of adjustment requires a different set of tools, so review the list below before getting started. 

## Tools Required

For frame adjustments:

* 5mm hex key (allen wrench)

For eccentric nut adjustments:

* 10mm open end box wrench
* 8mm open end box wrench
* 4mm hex key

For belt tensioning adjustments: 

* 6mm hex key (allen wrench)
* 12mm socket wrench

## How to Adjust

Before we begin, it is important to understand how each of these adjustment points function. 

**Note:** The following frame adjustments were already performed at the factory and are not necessary for most users. You should only need to adjust the frame if you have previously taken the printer apart, or ave adjsuted all eccentric nuts and are still experiencing binding at certain points on your axis. 

Starting with the frame adjustment points, these are the easiest. To adjust the frame adjustment points, you simply loosen the hex nut bolts in the frame (2 at each point) with a 5mm hex key and twist the metal frame extrusions slightly. There won't be much movement for most of the adjustment points, and it may feel like it's not moving at all, but it is important to ensure these contact points are equal and square, otherwise your axis may bind  or you may have erratic print behavior at the extreme ends of your print volume. 

Moving on to the eccentric nuts - This will be the most common type of tuning you perform on your printer. To begin adjustment of an eccentric nut, you take the 4mm hex key and place it in the hex head of the bolt running through the wheel and the eccentric nut. On the other end, you will place the 8mm open end box wrench and loosen the bolt slightly. It does not need to be very loose, and if it is too loose, that will impact your ability to adjust the eccentric nut effectively. Once the bolt is loosened slightly, you can then take the 10mm open end box wrench and spint he larger nut in between the wheel and the build plate. The nut is offset slightly so that as it spins it applies a different amount of pressure between the wheel and the plate. I recommend spinning the nut around completely at least once to get a feel for how the tension changes as it rotates around the bolt. Don't worry about "over tightening" the eccentric nut, as it doesn't actually tighten at all. It spins freely around the bolt with no threads running through the center. You can adjust the eccentric nut in either direction, so play around with it to get a feel for how it adjusts. 

Once you've found the desired tension on the eccentric nut, you will need to tighten the bolt back down using the 4mm hex key and the 8mm open end box wrench using the same process you used to loosen it. You're not trying to tighten the bolt down completely, you're just trying to make it snug enough so that the eccentric nut cannot be moved easily and is held in place. It's imporant to note that when tigthening the bolt, it will slightly tighten up the eccentric nut a little more than what you adjusted it to, so it may take a couple tries before you get the feeling down of how tight each eccentric nut and wheel should be.

### Process

When properly tuned, the X Axis should move easily side to side, but should not wobble front to back, nor should the print head wobble front to back on the chassis. There are 2 primary points of adjustment and 4 secondary points of adjustment.  

To begin adjusting the X axis, Move the x axis all the way to the top or bottom of the axis (I recommend bottom). Start by loosening the right side eccentric nut to the point that the wheel is still touching the frame, but can spin freely by hand without moving the chassis. Afterwards, loosen the left side eccentric nut to the same point. Test the movement of the x axis up and down. It may be slightly difficult to move at this point due to some minor torquing of the chassis on the lead screw. Adjust the left side eccentric nut so that it tightens up agains the railing a small amount. At this point, the left eccentric nut wheel should be snug against the frame and
